if we want to persist data in our logs folder in api and also have live
sourceCode changes, we can run the below command( if our api is in nodejs
we need also other configurations for nodemon which I didnt implement here)

docker run -d --name app-back-ctn --rm --network app-net -p 80:80 \
-v logs:/app/logs/ \
-v /c/Users/Mohcen/Desktop/Docker/backend:/app \
-v /app/node_modules \
app-back-img
