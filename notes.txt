if we delete the database container, we lose previous data, to persist data we can:
    ### docker run -d --name mongodb --network app-net -v data:data/db/ mongo
    we're actually using a names volume to persist data even if we delete our db container
another concern is the security of our database, and we don't want everyone to be able to connect to it
first we must declare username and password's for our database in docker run command:
    ### docker run -d --name mongodb --network app-net -v data:data/db/  -e MONGO_INIDB_ROOT_USERNAME=mosari307 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=aaa???123A mongo
then we would have to inform our database container of these information while we are try
to connect to the database in our api code
    ### 'mongodb://mosari307:aaa???123A@mongodb:27017/course-goals?authSource=admin'
    (since I had ?'s in my password I have to change it like I have in app.js)
